## What is Brain and Cognitive Science?

---
Brain and Cognitive Science (BCS) is the study of the mind and the brain, using a wide range methodologies and 
approaches, including those from biology, neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, philosophy, and 
computer science.

BCS is used to study a vast array of topics, including:
 
 - how humans, animals, and machines can perceive, learn, remember, and use information.
 - how human nature and human culture have come to be, and how they shape individuals, groups, and society; 
 - what is the nature of the mind and intelligence, and how it may be different in adults 
and children, in human and in nonhuman animals, and in humans and machines.
 - how "non-cognitive" properties of organisms (like bodies, emotions, and personalities) interact with the mind
to shape and create behavior

## About this Module

---
This module is designed to provide an introduction to Brain and Cognitive Science (BCS).
The intention is to cover BCS is it's full interdisciplinary glory, including:

 - introducing some of the foundational and most common ideas and theories of BCS
 - surveying how different academic fields of study (such as philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, 
 linguistics, anthropology, and computer science) have contributed to BCS
 - describing some of the main topics of study in BCS, including sensation and perception, learning and memory, 
 language and semantic knowledge, and intelligence, reasoning, and decision making.

## How to Read this Book

---
This module is divided up into sub-modules (and sub-sub-modules).
They are like chapters (and sub-chapters) within a book.
This particular module is written in a linear manner, and so can be read like a book.
When you are ready to begin, start with the "What is BCS?" submodule, accessible in 
the menu on the left.
You can read each subsection by following the menus on the left, or by clicking the 
"Next..." links within each subsections.

As described in the introduction to this module, one important principle of this module will be applying what cognitive 
scientists have learned about learning, in terms of how this information was constructed, how it was organized, and how
we recommend you use read it in order to maximize your understanding and comprehension of the material. This is 
especially true if you are reading this as a part of an official course where you will be tested. Whatever the reason, 
if you are trying to maximize your understanding and performance, you should follow the advise below. The common theme 
to each of these steps is to convert reading from a passive exercise to an active exercise. When you are reading with a 
purpose, and engaging your mind in other ways other than running your sense organs over the material, this means you are 
encoding the material in multiple ways, making connections you otherwise wouldnt have made, and giving yourself more 
memory cues to recall the information.

### 1. Read and answer the pre-reading questions at the beginning of each chapter.
Each submodule (1.1, 1.2, etc.) begins with a set of "Pre-Reading Questions". These are not rhetorical questions or 
there for decoration. You should really read and try to answer these questions, either in your notes or at least in 
your mind. If you mentally engage with these questions, and think about them before you start reading, it will help 
focus your mind on the reading to come. These questions summarize the main points of that section, and the text is 
designed to help you answer these questions. You should think about the questions beforehand, and then read the content 
with the goal in mind of discovering the answer to those questions. THis will focus on reading for the answer to those 
questions will help you encode the information,focus your mind on what is important, and help you remember the
information later, because you can use the questions themselves as memory retrieval cues. So please, think about and 
answer pre-reading questions before you begin.
 
### 2. Take notes using the Cornell note-taking method or something similar.
Another action that will help you encode adn remember the the information is to take notes using an organizational 
method like the Cornell note-taking method. In the Cornell method, you create a separate section in your notes for each 
section, chapter, or sub-module in what you are reading (i.e. separate sections in your notes for Submodule 1.1, 1.2, 
and so on). At the top of this section of notes, write the name of the section. It can also be helpful to write down
the pre-reading questions, and your answers, at the top of each section. 

After answering the pre-reading questions, divide your notes into a left and right section, with the right section 
taking about ⅔-¾ of the page. You can do this by drawing a line, or by labeling the left side “cues” and the right 
side “notes”. As you read, take notes by using the left side for key terms, major questions (such as the pre-reading 
questions, when they appear in the text), and other organizing information. The detailed notes are then taken in the 
right column. In this way, the left and the right column can serve as a useful and organized study aid. You can even 
use them like flash cards, covering up one side and seeing if you can use one column to remember what is in the other 
one.

Finally, when you are done reading, conclude by section at the bottom of your notes that spans both columns, and label
this section "Summary". In this section, and referring back to your notes as little as possible, try to summarize
the main points of this section in a paragraph. This step is very important, as it helps your mind consolidate the
information you just read, and reinforces the goal-directed nature of the exercise.
 
### 3. Make use of the interactive activities that are embedded throughout the module.
In addition to the text within each submodule, there are also embedded exercises, activities, and other suggestions 
for helping you learn and master the content. As we have said, one of the most certain ways of understanding and 
remembering new information is to turn reading into an active exercise, rather than a passive exercise. So please, do 
not skip over these activities and interactive sections. They are there for a reason, and often contain important 
details that are not in the text.
 
### 4. Read and answer the "Check your understanding" questions at the end of each submodule.
Finally, when you are finished reading each submodule, you will see a set of questions for checking your understanding.
Read and answer them, ideally at the bottom of your notes for that section under your summary paragraph. Often these
questions are repeats or rewordings of the pre-reading questions, and they are designed to help you see if you
successfully found the answers to those questions in the text.




 


For example, each submodule begins with pre-reading questions.
