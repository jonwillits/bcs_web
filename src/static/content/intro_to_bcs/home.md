## What is Brain and Cognitive Science

---
Brain and Cognitive Science (BCS) is the study of the mind and the brain, using a wide range methodologies and 
approaches, including those from biology, neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, philosophy, and 
computer science.

BCS is used to study a vast array of topics, including:
 
 - how humans, animals, and machines can perceive, learn, remember, and use information.
 - how human nature and human culture have come to be, and how they shape individuals, groups, and society; 
 - what is the nature of the mind and intelligence, and how it may be different in adults 
and children, in human and in nonhuman animals, and in humans and machines.
 - how "non-cognitive" properties of organisms (like bodies, emotions, and personalities) interact with the mind
to shape and create behavior

## How to Read this Book

---
This module is divided up into sub-modules (and sub-submodules).
They are like chapters (and sub-chapters) within a book.
This particular module is written in a linear manner, and so can be read like a book.
When you are ready to begin, start with the "What is BCS?" submodule, accessible in 
the menu on the left.
You can read each subsection by following the menus on the left, or by clicking the 
"Next..." links within each subsections.
 
But addition to stuff to read within each submodule, there are also embedded
exercises, activities, and other suggestions for helping you learn and master the content.
Remember, this book is about Brain and Cognitive Science, written by people who study 
Brain and Cognitive Science. We have suggestions for how to learn and remember information.
If you engage with these activities, it will help you learn and remember the information.

For example, each submodule begins with pre-reading questions. These are not rhetorical 
questions or there for decoration.
If you mentally engage with them, and think about them before you start reading, 
it will help.
These questions summarize the main points of that section, and the text is designed 
to help you answer these questions.
If you think about the questions beforehand, and then read the content with the goal in mind
of discovering the answer to those questions, it will help you encode the information,
focus your mind on what is important, and help you remember the information.
So please, think about and answer pre-reading questions before you begin.
