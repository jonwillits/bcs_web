## What is Brain and Cognitive Science?
Brain and Cognitive Science (BCS) is the study of the mind and the brain, using a wide range methodologies and 
approaches, including those from biology, neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, philosophy, and 
computer science.

BCS is used to study a vast array of topics, including:
 
 - how humans, animals, and machines can perceive, learn, remember, and use information.
 - how human nature and human culture have come to be, and how they shape individuals, groups, and society; 
 - what is the nature of the mind and intelligence, and how it may be different in adults 
and children, in human and in nonhuman animals, and in humans and machines.
 - how "non-cognitive" properties of organisms (like bodies, emotions, and personalities) interact with the mind
to shape and create behavior
