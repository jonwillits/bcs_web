# 1.4. Ten Questions for Brain and Cognitive Science

#### 1.4.8. How can we improve the mind and brain?

---
Many of the questions so far were abstract, theoretical, scholarly, or science fiction-y. But this question (and the next one) are about what we can do, here and now, to improve people’s lives by what we have learned about the mind and brain. One major kind of answer has to do with all the ways that we can actually make the mind itself better. Of course, one of the most obvious ways we can make the mind better is through learning. Learning new things gives the mind new capabilities. A good portion of brain and cognitive science research is dedicated to learning: how minds do it, what kinds of things are easy and hard to learn, and how we can improve the learning process at all stages of life. A second kind of answer about how we can improve the mind involves more...direct methods. Drugs, surgery, meditation, brain training apps, you’ve probably heard about how some or all of these have been suggested to improve the brain. Do they work? A lot of cognitive science research is investigating these ideas.
