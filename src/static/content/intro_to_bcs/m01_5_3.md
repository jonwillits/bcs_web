## George Conway's Game of Life

We have another scientific investigation to perform.
In the simulation below, you can click on a cell, making it "come alive" (turn from grey to yellow). 
You can live observe what happens over time by clicking the "Next" button to advance the world one time step, or clicking the "Start" button to allow it to advance many time steps. 
Try creating some life and observing what happens. Can you discover any patterns or rules or regularities?
Imagine that you are a scientist trying to discover the "laws" of this world. What are they?
Work in your group to try to discover the laws of this world..
