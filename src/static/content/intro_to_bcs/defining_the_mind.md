### What is a mind?
Your mind should be easy to understand. Consider how much experience you have with it. 
Every moment you are there, it is there too. 
In fact, this equivalence of your mind with your very existence was at the core of the French philosopher Descartesâ€™s "I think, therefore I am" argument.
Descartes, was ruminating about whether he could ever truly be certain about anything. 
What if an evil demon was deceiving him, and falsifying his sensory input. 
All of the conclusions he could draw from observing the world could be a lie!
How could he know if anything he believes is actually true?
Descartes concluded that there was one thing he could be certain of.
This is the fact that he must, in fact, exist. 
Because if he did not exist, then there was no way he could be thinking about this uncertainty, or asking this question, in the first place.
The very fact that he could think, was evidence that he did, in fact, exist.
