## What is a mind?
Your mind should be easy to understand. Consider how much experience you spend with it. 
Every moment you are there, it is there too. 
In fact, this equivalence of your mind with your very existence is at the core of the French philosopher 
Descartesâ€™s I think, therefore I am argument. Descartes, was ruminating about whether he could ever truly be certain 
about anything. What if an evil demon was deceiving him, and falsifying his sensory input. 
All of the conclusions he could draw from observing the world could be a lie! 
Descartes concluded that the the one thing he could be certain of was that he does in fact exist, 
because if he did not, then there was no way he could be thinking about this uncertainty in the first place.
The very fact that he could think, was evidence that he did, in fact, exist.
