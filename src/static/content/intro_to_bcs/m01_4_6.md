#### 1.4.6. What is the relationship between mind and culture, language, and social behavior?

Our mind is clearly constrained by our human biology. We have hands, we stand upright, we see certain colors but not others (like ultraviolet and infrared). Our biology constrains what we perceive and what actions we can take. By the same token, human culture, language, and social systems surely play a role in constraining our mind as well. What does the ability to use language allow our mind to do that it otherwise could not. In 1984, George Orwell famously speculated that culture without a word for freedom would not even be able to think about the idea. Is this true? Does our language and culture shape our thoughts?
