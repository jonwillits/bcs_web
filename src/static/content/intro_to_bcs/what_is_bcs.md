## What is Brain and Cognitive Science?

# About this Module
This module is designed to provide an introduction to the scientific study of the brain,
and cognitive science. Brain and Cognitive Science (BCS) is a very broad, interdisciplinary
field, incorporating techniques and knowledge from low-level subdomains like biology and 
neuroscience, to high level subdomains like psychology, anthropology, and linguistics. BCS
is used to study a vast array of topics, including:
- how humans and animals perceive, learn, and remember information
- how human nature and human culture have come to be, and how they shape individuals, 
groups, and society; 
- what is the nature of the mind and intelligence, and how it may be different in adults 
and children, in human and in nonhuman animals, and in humans and machines
