# 1.4. Ten Questions for Brain and Cognitive Science

#### 1.4.7. Do animals and machines have minds?

---
Of both practical and applied importance is the question of whether humans are the only entities that have minds. Do other animals have minds? In what ways are they similar and different from ours, and what can that tell us about the nature of the mind itself. And as we learn more about animal minds (and learn that they are more similar to our own than we thought), what are the ethical implications that are raised for the ways that we treat animals in our society?

A similar question arises with regard to artificial minds. Can a computer ever have a mind? What would it take for one to exist? If not, what is it that is special about biological substances that gives rise to mind? And could we in some distant future build an artificially created biological entity that had a mind? If machines can have minds (or if we create them from biological materials), what are the ethical consequences of doing so. Should we feel bad about how we treat computers? Can you torture a character in a game? And should we be worried about artificial intelligence? Is it dangerous? Movies like The Matrix and The Terminator speculate that the machines may try to rule or eliminate us. How scared should we be?
