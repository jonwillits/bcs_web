# 1.4. Ten Questions for Brain and Cognitive Science

---
#### 1.4.1. What is a mind?

---
We have already introduced this question, and will discuss it at more length in Chapter 2. But the question of “what is the mind” is one of the fundamental questions of Brain and Cognitive Science. How one answers this question often has explicit and subconscious effects on how one goes about conducting more specific questions about the mind or brain. It is therefore of great importance that we ask what are the necessary and sufficient conditions to consider something a mind? What are the features, properties, functions, and purpose of mind? How does mind arise from physical matter? These questions have puzzled humanity for as long as we have physical records.
