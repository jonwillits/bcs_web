# 1.4. Ten Questions for Brain and Cognitive Science

---
#### 1.4.1. What is a mind?

---
We have already introduced this question, and will discuss it at more length in Chapter 2. But the question of “what is the mind” is one of the fundamental questions of Brain and Cognitive Science. How one answers this question often has explicit and implicit effects on how one goes about answering more specific questions about the mind or brain. It is therefore of some importance that we continue to ask about the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be considered a mind. What are the features, properties, functions, and purpose of mind? How does mind arise from physical matter? These questions have puzzled humanity for as long as we have physical records. We may never be able to come up with a satisfactory answer, but we can still learn much by making the attempt.
