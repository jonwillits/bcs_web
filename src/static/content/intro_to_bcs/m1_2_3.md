# 1.2. The Relationship Between Mind and Brain

### 1.2.3. Is the Mind the Same as the Brain?

---
Scientists often approach the mind-body problem (or ignore the mind-body problem) by talking about the mind the brain as different “levels of analysis”. What does this mean? There are a number of ways we can think about this, but it can be easiest to use other sciences as an example.

Consider the case of physics, chemistry, and biology. No chemist of biologist would deny that the laws of physics define and govern what happens in biological organisms. It is not like, for understanding the properties of a cell, the laws of physics (like the laws of motion, and momentum, and friction, and so on) do not exist, or do not matter. We could predict and explain everything about the state of a cell by determining where the protons, neutrons, and electrons were at any given moment. But the average cell contains something like 100 trillion (100,000,000,000,000) atoms! And each atom could contain dozens or hundreds of protons, neutrons, and electrons (depending on what kind of atom it is). That would be a hell of a complicated explanation! The whole point of science is that there regularities that exist at various levels that can make explanations more tractable. In a physics model of a cell, we would need to keep track of hundreds of billions of interacting parts. In a chemistry model of a cell, might be able to reduce that to hundreds of millions of different chemical compounds. A biological model of a cell might allow us to reduce that to only dozens or hundreds of different kinds of entities. Cells are still complicated at the biological level! But their complicatedness is reduced to something tractable, by noting that their are biological regularities that are composed of chemistry regularities, that are themselves composed of physics regularities. Do these higher level regularities explain everything perfectly? No. Sometimes we need to drop back down to the next level down to explain some complicated phenomenon. Cellular reproduction could be affected by the electrical charges surrounding certain molecules, and so chemistry, or even physics, is required. But many biological facts can be explained by sticking to the biological level of explanation.

Many scientists assume (and hope) that the mind is like this. Explaining the mind in terms of all of the individual neurons and their connections would be extremely complicated. There are approximately 100,000,000,000 neurons in the human brain. But by understanding that collections of neurons are working together in the service of performing particular functions, we can explain how the mind works in terms of understanding the relationships amongst those functions, without always needing to drop back down to the biological level of explanation. Sometimes we will have to. But the idea is that the higher levels of analysis (like cognitive psychology, linguistics, and anthropology) will have regularities that are predictive and valuable.
