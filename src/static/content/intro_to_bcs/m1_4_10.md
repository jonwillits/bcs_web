# 1.4. Ten Questions for Brain and Cognitive Science

---
#### 1.4.10. What are the moral and ethical consequences of what we have learned about the mind and brain?

---
Our last question is one of the most important. What are we learning about the mind and brain that shapes our beliefs about how we ought to act. Many peopleâ€™s moral and political beliefs change when they learn more about the brain. Does a better understanding of free will, and when we do and do not possess it, shape how we think about justice and holding people responsible for their actions? What does the nature-nurture debate tell us about high profile political issues like gender identity and sexual orientation? Does the way that different drugs affect the brain affect our thoughts, even common drugs like alcohol and caffeine, affect our beliefs about how accessible those drugs should be? Should the fact that the mind and thought begin before birth affect how we think about reproductive politics? Should the nature of animal minds have an effect how we treat them? Science does not occur in a vacuum, independent of the rest of human society. There are many moral and ethical questions raised by brain and cognitive science that our culture will need to deal with.
