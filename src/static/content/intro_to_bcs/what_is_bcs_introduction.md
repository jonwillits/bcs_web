# What is Brain and Cognitive Science?

---
## Submodule Overview

---
This submodule provides an introduction to the course as a whole.
We will discuss useful scientific definitions of the mind, talk about the relationship
between the mind and the brain, and talk about the early history of the field.
The submodule will conclude by summarizing the current state of the field of brain and 
cognitive science, and by discussing ten important and unanswered questions about the mind
and brain.

## How to Read this Submodule

---
As described in the preface, one important principle of this book will be applying what cognitive scientists have 
learned about the learning process itself to the writing of this book, and the advice about how to read it. One of the 
most important principles about reading and retaining information is that you get a lot more out of it if you are 
reading with a purpose, and do it in an active manner.

The first step is to take notes using an organizational method like the Cornell note-taking method. In this method, 
you create a separate section in your notes for each sub-module in the book (i.e. separate sections in your notes for 
Submodule 1.1, 1.2, and so on). At the top of this section of notes, write the name of the section. Under the 
section name, copy the pre-reading questions, and  jot down your thoughts, ideas, or opinions about the answers to the 
questions. This step is very important! It gets your mind thinking about certain questions before you start reading.
 What you should realize is that answering these questions is the purpose of this section, and so you should be reading 
 this section specifically trying to discover the answers to these questions.

After answering the pre-reading questions, divide your notes into a left and right section, with the right section 
taking about ⅔-¾ of the page. You can do this by drawing a line, or by labeling the left side “cues” and the right 
side “notes”. As you read, take notes by using the left side for key terms, major questions (such as the pre-reading 
questions, when they appear in the text), and other organizing information. The detailed notes are then taken in the 
right column. In this way, the left and the right column can serve as a useful and organized study aid. You can even 
use them like flash cards, covering up one side and seeing if you can use one column to remember what is in the other 
one.

Finally, when you are done reading, conclude by section at the bottom of your notes that spans both columns, and label
this section "Summary". In this section, and referring back to your notes as little as possible, try to summarize
the main points of this section in a paragraph. This step is very important, as it helps your mind consolidate the
information you just read, and reinforces the goal-directed nature of the exercise.
