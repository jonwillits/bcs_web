# 1.4. Ten Questions for Brain and Cognitive Science

#### 1.4.5. How did each mind come to be?

---
Minds do not appear fully-formed and fully functional. How do they come to be. How do our genes lead to the development of a  mind in each person? How much, and which parts, of a mind are specified by our genes? What parts of it instead come from our experiences, our environment, and our culture? The nature vs. nurture debate has been a study of the mind from the very beginning, and will continue to be so for a long time to come?

And just as how we can ask how individual minds develop over the course of a life-span, we can also ask how minds came to be over the course of evolution. By our best estimates, life began on earth at least 4.5 billion years ago. When it did so, it took the form of simple, self-replicating RNA or DNA molecules. Was mind already present at this early moment? Probably not. But when did it emerge? Was it when cells began to develop the ability to process information about their environment? Was it when collections of cells started congregating together in the first multi-celled organisms? Was it when the first neuron cell evolved? Was it when certain brain structures evolved? What step in biological evolution was the critical step in the evolution of mind?
