# 1.4. Ten Questions for Brain and Cognitive Science

#### 1.4.3. What is the Relationship Between Mind and Matter?

---
As we have already discussed, and will discuss much more, the relationship between the mind and the brain (and the rest of the body) is a question that has vexed humanity for as long as we have written records. Our body is clearly a material thing. We can look at brains. We can dissect them. We can analyze them like machines. We can take them apart and (hopefully) put them back together. They follow simple laws of biology, chemistry, and physics.

The mind is...not like that. Our inner experiences are subjective. There is nothing we can point to, grab, or get a handle on. How can something that feels so inherently non-physical be explained in terms of the body and brain?
