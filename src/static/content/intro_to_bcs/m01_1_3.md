Philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists might give different answers to a question like this. Philosophers of mind have 

Cognitive psychology can be seen as answering this question in a slightly different way. Cognitive psychology got its start in the 1960s and 1970s when the digital computer was a new and exciting tool that was reshaping human society. Early cognitive psychologists (like George Miller) took the digital computer as a model for how the   mind might work. This often took the form of a functionalist perspective, dividing the mind up into different functions or different processes that have different purposes. For example, there might be many different perceptual processes (like visual perception, auditory perception, and so on) whose purpose was to take information in from the outside world and convert it into an internal representation of that information that could serve as input. Other processes might include attention (used to decide what aspects of our perceptual input are most important right now), memory (for storing those representations for retrieval at a later time), and decision-making (for taking the set of choices about what actions we might take and selecting one of those actions.
