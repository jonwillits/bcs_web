# Intro to Python Programming for Brain and Cognitive Science

---
## Overview of this module

---
This module is designed to provide an introduction to computer programming in the Python programming language.
This module begins with an introduction to the Python language and all of its core features and functionality.
The module then continues with a bunch of advanced topics and applications to BCS-related topics, like machine learning,
data science, computer models and simulations, and experiment and game programming. You can consider
this module to have three primary learning objectives:

 - to learn what computer programming is, and what one can accomplish using computer programs
 - to master the basics of how to write computer programs in the Python programming language, including its syntax and proper programming technique and style
 - to discuss how computer programs, models, and simulations contribute to research about cognitive science.

## The teaching technique in this module

This module is organized a little differently than your standard book or tutorial on Python or introduction to programming.
This is because a major pedagogical assumption is that people who are new learners in a domain learn best when
they are more motivated to learn, and have a better understanding of why they are learning the things that they are learning.
As such, this module is organized around the idea of completing particular projects. This means that rather
than starting with learning all of the simple basic building blocks, and then the medium stuff, and then the big complex things,
we sometimes have to jump into some of the medium and advanced stuff right at the beginning in order to make programs and do 
projects that are actually interesting and motivating. Don't worry, it will be easy and more fun than the alternative.

## The organization of this module

This module is divided up into sub-modules (and sub-sub-modules). Think of them like chapters in a book. Each of them is
designed to teach some core parts of python or things that you can do with it that apply to Brain and Cognitive Science.
The first 10 sections really focus on core Python prinicples, and the sections after that go into applications.

## The supplemental materials for this module

---
This module was written primarily as a textbook to be used as a college course (BCOG 200) at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As such, there are associated homework assignments,
lab activities, and lecture slides for the course. These are all available at the author's Github
